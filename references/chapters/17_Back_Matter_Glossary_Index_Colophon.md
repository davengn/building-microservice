Amazon	Web	Services	(AWS)

The	public	cloud	offering	from	Amazon.

API	gateway

A	component	that	normally	sits	on	the	perimeter	of	a	system	and	routes	calls
from	external	sources	(such	as	user	interfaces)	to	microservices,	amongst
many	other	things.

authentication

The	process	whereby	a	principal	proves	that	they	are	who	they	say	they	are.
This	could	be	as	simple	as	a	person	providing	their	username	and	password.

The	process	that	determines	if	an	authorized	principal	is	allowed	to	access	a
given	piece	of	functionality.

Azure

The	public	cloud	offering	from	Microsoft.

specific	user	interface.	An	alternative	to	a	general-purpose	API	gateway.

bounded	context

An	explicit	boundary	within	a	business	domain	that	provides	functionality	to

the	wider	system,	but	which	also	hides	complexity.	Often	maps	to
organizational	boundaries.	A	concept	from	DDD.

bulkhead

A	part	of	the	system	in	which	a	failure	can	be	isolated,	so	that	the	rest	of	the
system	can	keep	operating	even	if	a	failure	occurs.

choreography

A	style	of	saga,	where	responsibility	for	what	should	happen	when	is
distributed	across	multiple	microservices,	rather	than	managed	by	a	single
entity.

collective	ownership

A	style	of	ownership	in	which	any	developer	is	allowed	to	change	any	part	of

lightweight.

continuous	delivery	(CD)

A	delivery	approach	in	which	you	explicitly	model	the	path	to	production,

suitability	of	any	release	candidate	to	be	deployed	into	production.

continuous	deployment

An	approach	wherein	any	build	that	passes	all	automated	steps	is
automatically	deployed	into	production.

continuous	integration	(CI)

The	observation	that	the	communication	structures	of	organizations	end	up
driving	the	design	of	the	computer	systems	that	these	organizations	build.

The	extent	to	which	changing	one	part	of	the	system	requires	a	change	in
another.	Low	coupling	is	normally	desirable.

cross-functional	requirement	(CFR)

A	general	property	of	the	system,	such	as	the	required	latency	for	operations,

greatly	prefer	cross-functional	as	a	description).

customizable	off	the	shelf	software	(COTS)

Third-party	software	that	is	heavily	customized	by	the	end	user	and	is	also

care	about—for	example	“Order	Placed”	or	“User	Logs	In.”

feature	branching

Creating	a	new	branch	for	each	feature	that	is	being	worked	on,	merging	that
branch	back	into	mainline	once	the	feature	is	complete.	Something	I
discourage.

Function	as	a	Service	(FaaS)

A	type	of	serverless	platform	that	invokes	arbitary	code	based	on	certain
types	of	triggers—for	example,	launching	code	in	reaction	to	an	HTTP	call,

BFF	or	API	gateways.

horizontal	duplication

Scaling	a	system	by	having	multiple	copies	of	a	thing.

idempotency

The	ability	to	make	a	change	to	a	microservice	and	deploy	it	into	production
without	having	to	change	or	deploy	anything	else.

management	to	be	automated	and	the	code	to	be	version	controlled.

JSON	Web	Token

A	standard	for	creating	a	JSON	data	structure	that	can	be	optionally

The	need	to	deploy	two	or	more	things	at	the	same	time,	because	a	change
has	occurred	that	requires	it.	The	opposite	of	independent	deployability.	In
general,	avoid.

message

Something	sent	to	one	or	more	downstream	microservices	via	an
asynchronous	communication	mechanism	like	a	broker.	Could	contain	a
variety	of	payloads,	such	as	a	request,	response,	or	an	event.

transactions	when	implementing	business	processes.

serverless

An	umbrella	term	for	cloud	products	that	from	the	user’s	point	of	view
abstract	away	the	underlying	computers,	to	the	extent	that	the	user	no	longer
needs	to	care	about	them.	Examples	of	these	products	include	AWS	Lambda,
AWS	S3,	and	Azure	Cosmos.

service-level	agreement	(SLA)

An	agreement	between	an	end	user	and	a	service	provider	(e.g.,	customer

About	the	Author

Sam	Newman	is	an	independent	consultant,	an	author,	and	a	speaker.	In	over	20
years	in	the	industry,	he	has	worked	across	different	technology	stacks	and	in
different	domains	with	companies	all	over	the	world.	His	main	focus	is	in
helping	organizations	get	software	into	production	more	quickly	and	safely,	and
helping	them	navigate	the	complexities	of	microservices.	He	is	also	the	author	of
Monolith	to	Microservices,	also	from	O’Reilly.

Colophon

The	animals	on	the	cover	of	Building	Microservices,	Second	Edition,	are
honeybees	(of	the	genus	Apis).	Of	the	more	than	20,000	species	of	bees,	there
are	only	eight	species	of	honeybees.	These	social-nesting	bees	are	unique	in	how
they	collectively	produce	and	store	honey,	as	well	as	build	hives	from	wax.
Beekeeping	to	collect	honey	has	been	a	human	pursuit	around	the	world	for
thousands	of	years.

Honeybee	hives	contain	thousands	of	individuals	and	have	a	very	organized
social	structure	comprising	a	queen,	drones,	and	workers.	Each	hive	has	one
queen,	which	remains	fertile	for	3–5	years	after	her	mating	flight	and	lays	up	to
2,000	eggs	per	day.	Drones	are	male	bees	that	mate	with	the	queen	(and	die	in
the	act	because	of	their	barbed	sex	organs).	Worker	bees	are	sterile	females	that
fill	many	roles	during	their	lifetime,	such	as	nursemaid,	construction	worker,
grocer,	guard,	undertaker,	and	forager.	Pollen-laden	worker	bees	returning	to	the
hive	“dance”	in	set	patterns	to	communicate	information	about	nearby	food.

Though	queens	are	a	bit	larger,	honeybees	are	otherwise	similar	in	appearance,
with	transparent	wings,	six	legs,	and	a	body	segmented	into	a	head,	thorax,	and
abdomen.	They	have	short	fuzzy	hairs	in	a	striped	yellow	and	black	pattern.	The
adults’	diet	is	made	up	exclusively	of	honey,	which	is	created	by	a	process	of
partially	digesting	and	then	regurgitating	sugar-rich	flower	nectar.

Bees	are	crucial	to	agriculture;	as	they	collect	their	food,	they	pollinate	crops.
Commercial	bee	hives	are	transported	by	beekeepers	to	where	crops	need	to	be
pollinated.	On	average,	each	hive	of	bees	gathers	66	pounds	of	pollen	a	year.	In
recent	years,	however,	colony	collapse	disorder,	brought	about	by	a	variety	of
diseases	and	other	stressors,	has	caused	an	alarming	decline	among	honeybee
species.

Honeybees	are	vulnerable	to	the	same	pesticides	and	introduced	parasites	and
diseases	that	have	driven	down	numbers	of	wild	bees	and	other	pollinators,	but
honeybees	do	have	some	human	support	and	protection	because	they	are	key	in
agriculture.	Many	of	the	animals	on	O’Reilly	covers	are	endangered;	all	of	them
are	important	to	the	world.

The	cover	color	illustration	is	by	Karen	Montgomery,	based	on	a	black	and	white
engraving	from	The	Pictorial	Museum	of	Animated	Nature.	The	cover	fonts	are

Gilroy	and	Guardian	Sans.	The	text	font	is	Adobe	Minion	Pro;	the	heading	font
is	Adobe	Myriad	Condensed;	and	the	code	font	is	Dalton	Maag’s	Ubuntu	Mono.
